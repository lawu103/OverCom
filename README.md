<b>What Is OverCom?</b>

OverCom is a fan-created game set in Blizzard’s Overwatch universe, featuring turn-based squad combat inspired by the likes of Firaxis's XCOM. All characters from Overwatch will be re-created in this unique setting, complete with their abilities, characteristics, and ultimates. The game itself is built in Unity 3D and off of the TBS Framework, available at https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/50282. 

OverCom’s core gameplay revolves around tactical turn-based combat missions, where up to six player-controlled units face off against AI- or enemy-controlled units. Mission types vary from objective-based, such as capturing an area, to good old-fashioned elimination. Players have the opportunity to choose which characters to send out before each mission, tailoring their squad to their needs.

The code here on Github is an extremely loose prototype, with much of the current work being put into planning out abilities, mechanics, etc. That being said, the final game will feature two gamemodes: Story and Skirmish, which are singleplayer and multiplayer respectively. Skirmish is currently being developed and will allow two players to battle each other with 6-unit squads. This mode will feature the heaviest inspiration from Overwatch, including no restrictions as to who can add which characters to their squads. The story - essentially a player-vs-AI experience - will follow Overwatch's reinstatement as a peacekeeping force and challenge the player to track down and eliminate the terrorist group known as Talon. However, this is an extremely long-term goal, and Skirmish is the largest priority as of the moment.

OverCom is a project meant for fun with no monetization plan.
